1.0.5.1

 * Update the changelog before adding release tag so it shows up properly on the pages that curse generates

1.0.5

 * Updated .toc for 5.0.4

Crossing fingers that this works; I looked at what's been updated and I
think it should be okay, but it's completely untested.

1.0.4

 * Updated .toc for 4.3
 * Added README and otherwise set up for curse packaging

1.0.3

 * Updated .toc for 4.2

1.0.2

 * Updated .toc for 4.1

1.0.1

 * Config panel slightly reorganized
 * Cleaned up config code

1.0 Declaring it release-ready

 * I have continued testing didn't find any bugs in the past 48 hours.  Previously I found bugs every day and never received one bug report.  Apparently posting betas isn't effective.  Though I did hear from someone that it worked the first day there weren't any, so...  who knows.
 * Slightly further expanded help and about

0.6 Basic raid support, bugfix

 * Raid support; like in a party it will now automatically assist a tank in your raid.  The issue remains that it's a lot more likely to run into multiple tanks (it will pick one of them) in which case you're probably better off picking one manually.
 * Should behave correctly when someone uses the set role option to make the tank not a tank
 * Continued code reorganization

0.5 No-tank options, more chat spam removed

 * Make applying marks when there's no tank an option rather than standard behavior
 * Actually no longer will sometimes first tell you that it is assisting "Unknown" when a tank joins the party (Did you know that WoW characters can't be named "Unknown"?)
 * Will no longer report the change multiple times when a tank joins the party in combat
 * Rewrote a bunch of code because I realized it could be more sensical

0.4 Better update messages, bugfixes

 * Fixed bug that prevented going from manual set to auto set mode
 * Update messages in chat now indicate whether the update was automatic or manual
 * There is now an update message when you switch between manual and automatic even if the tank/assist doesn't change
 * Removed event that was causing "assisting Unknown" immediately before assisting the correct tank on entering a dungeon; other events should cover every meaningful change
 * Fixed a bug that prevented changes in what mark to apply from being automatically updated
 * Broker plugin mentioned in help and MetaData.
 * Made manual set description in help clearer.

0.3 LibDataBroker support, bugfixes

 * Added broker plugin
 * Replaced a confusingly worded and misspelled status message, changed wording partly to simplify creating sensical broker text
 * Loading message before status message
 * Removed capitilization in the middle of binding tooltip in config panel
 * Fixed bug that interfered with manually assisting someone on another server

0.2 Initial beta

 * Tested 0.1 in one dungeon that did contain the major test cases; it worked
 * Removed debugging messages

0.1 Initial upload

Seriously needing some testing.  Hopefully has the following features:
 * Assist or mark keybinding that automatically assist the dugeon finder tank or marks if that's you
 * Another keybinding allows you to manually set who should be assisted
 * Information about what the primary keybinding will do printed to chat frame when it changes
 * Options and info panel

Particularly needs checking:
 * Setting assist after combat if it was changed in combat
 * Keep manually set assist when party changes
 * about/help section or page
 * all the descriptions make sense and are good
 * Only message when macro text is checked for update but doesn't actually change is the debug one

Still has lots of debugging spam
